# WebServer_go

In this project a web server with Go is created.

To do this, using a REST API we managed to create a client-server connection.

In this server we check that the EndPoint is valid and that the Rest request that we generate 
can be given in the corresponding path.

In addition we have several middleware:

1. We check the authentication of the user who wants to enter a certain path.

2. We check that the login was successful.

For testing we use Postman.

I show some examples of connectivity.
